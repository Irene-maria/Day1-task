        <h3>Student Management System</h3>
        <p>
          An academic manager for students, created using various data structures with Java. Students can view their grades, and see their improvements through this.<br> 
          Various subjects can be added and we can also add grades for each of the subjects. This is useful for students to keep track of their academics and to know where they need to improve in order to achieve a great academic score.

        <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
        <p>
          A study timer for effective learning, created using HTML and CSS. Students lose their focus so easily nowadays, so this timer is useful to keep your brain in focus.
          This includes a continuous study period of 25 min and a 5 min rest after that, in this way our brain can focus clearly and studying will be easier. Through this site that I created,
          students can set timer, take breaks in between and reset the timer too. They can also track how much time they've spent on their studies.

        <h3>Travel Guide App</h3>
        <p>
          The UI for an app that guides users through different stages of travelling,
          including travel tickets. Traveling can be a hassle and this app will make it easy for you, in this app you can add the list of things to be packed,
          all your important documents, it offers a travel guide, and various other useful features which will definintely help us all through the travel. Me and 
          my team came up with this idea and created a UI design for this app.
